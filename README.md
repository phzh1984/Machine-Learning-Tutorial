Machine Learning:

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of statistical techniques to allow systems to improve their performance on a specific task over time.

Supervised Learning:

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling it to make predictions or classify new, unseen data.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing and visualizing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA helps in understanding the structure of the data, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the 'k' nearest data points to a given input data point and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average of the 'k' neighbors (for regression).

Regression:

Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. The algorithm learns the relationship between the input variables and the target variable by fitting a mathematical function to the training data.

Cross Validation (CV):

Cross Validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by partitioning the dataset into subsets for training and testing. This helps in estimating how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data and mitigates issues like overfitting.

ROC Curve:

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a classification model at different classification thresholds. It plots the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, providing insights into the model's ability to discriminate between classes.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm to optimize its performance. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are not learned from the data but need to be set prior to the training process. Tuning helps find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given problem.

Pre-processing Data:
Pre-processing involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis or modeling. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers.

Unsupervised Learning:

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given input data without explicit output labels. The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, or structures within the data.

Kmeans Clustering:

Kmeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering. It partitions data into 'k' clusters based on similarity. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates cluster centroids until convergence.

Evaluation of Clustering:

Evaluation metrics like silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index are used to assess the quality of clustering results. These metrics measure the compactness of clusters and the separation between them.

Standardization:

Standardization is a pre-processing technique that rescales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It helps prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

Hierarchy (Hierarchical Clustering):

Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters, either by merging or splitting clusters based on similarity. It results in a tree-like structure, known as a dendrogram, representing the relationships between clusters.

T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE):

T-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It focuses on preserving local structures, making it useful for visualizing clusters or patterns.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the information. It identifies principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance in the data.

These concepts provide a foundation for understanding and working with machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and the essential steps in building predictive models.
